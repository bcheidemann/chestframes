# ChestFrames

ChestFrames is a Spigot Minecraft mod that allows you to click through item frames placed on chests, barrels and workbenches. This allows better labelling of storage chests, without the inconvenience of having to right click to the side of item frames to open chests. Players can interact with item frames normally by holding the crouch key.
